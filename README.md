JS Highlights – Revision Companion

Educational repo created by Eng. Omar Mosleh for students in the Open Source department. It mirrors what we covered in the JavaScript lectures and is meant to help you quickly revise core topics—not replace practice.

Purpose
- Reinforce concepts already taught.
- Give you a fast way to recall key concepts.
- Keep everything lightweight so you can prep before quizzes, or interviews.

How to Use the Material (Two Paths)
1. Full Pages (Recommended first pass): Open the daily `index.html` pages (root or inside each `JS-dayX/` folder). These are a bit more narrative and show concepts in context.
2. Cheat‑Sheets (Quick refresh): Each folder has a focused `*-cheat-sheet.md` file. These are terse, skimmable, and great right before an exam or coding session.

Suggested Flow
Read a page → experiment in your own sandbox → glance at the cheat‑sheet to lock it in.

Scope Covered (so far)
- Day 1: Intro & basics
- Day 2: Strings, arrays, dates, math
- Day 3: BOM, DOM traversal
- Day 4: DOM events
- Day 5: Functions & closures
- Day 6: Objects

Notes
- This is for learning; feel free to fork and annotate.
- If something feels unclear, bring it up in the next session.
- REVISIT the labs and assignments. re‑doing them is one of the most effective ways to retain and deepen understanding.

Happy coding.
